# Daily Journey Log - 2025-01-24

## Morning Reflection
*Begin each day by setting your intention and acknowledging the sacred space of creation*

Energy Level (1-10): 9
Current State of Mind: Bemused and contemplative
Daily Intention: Today is Friday, Venus's day. Let's place my intention today on honoring my values and seeking beauty by bringing it into my life on a more consistent basis, like daily.
How can I bring that asthetic into my daily life? Design the looks of what I can. Make a choice of what I want it to look like, and then ruthelessly seek it out until I have the design system in place.

That might be a bit much for one day, but this can be the long term goal of my Friday's in general. Today, let's just get Journeyman Advisors Rebrand up and Running, and a rough draft of the website, at least.
